# Overview

Have you ever felt like the spire is too flat? You're in a massive tower but apparently it's all lit up perfectly with no real variation. You use your moves to shoot laser beams at the denizens, but it emits no light.

Well, this mod fixes that. Introducing Lights Out!

By default this mod makes the spire a lot darker and allows many of the particles (and the cursor) to emit light of different colors that affect each other for a much nicer viewing experience. 

# Features

Out of the box, the passive lighting in the spire will drop by 85%, drastically increasing the effects seen by light sources and making the player dependent on their mouse, which will act as a flashlight in the dark.

Lighting data has been added to over 100 objects in the spire, including particle effects, background objects, relics, potions, and more.

Character Select screens have been given lights and glows.

Custom lighting data can be added by other mods that want to support lighting.

# Configurable

There's multiple modes that are configurable in the settings that allow you to tweak the radius and strength of your mouse light, the strength of the darkening and more. Please check out the config page to tweak any of the following:
* Quick enabling and disables of the mod
* Should the map have glow
* Should the glowing map have color
* Should monster intents glow
* Should the player mouse act as a flashlight (concentrated beam) or a lantern (less intense but more spread out)
* The radius of light around the mouse
* The ambient amount of light in the spire
